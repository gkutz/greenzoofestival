## Green Zoo Festival

**Green Zoo Festival** is a not-for-profit independent alternative urban [music festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_festival) held annually since 2011 between the middle of May and June, usually on weekends. The festival takes place in the city of [Kraków](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w) in [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland) at several venues and has hosted concerts by more than 100 musicians from around the world. The main mission of the festival is to integrate local musicians and those from around the world, DJs, journalists, photographers, graphic designers, promoters, and other artists, as well as regular concert goers, at the festival's various events. As a result, there is no clear distinction between concert performers, the general audience, and the independent media, arts and music industry crowd.

The organizers of this festival are the concert promoters from [Front Row Heroes](https://frontrowheroes.com/en/about-us/) based in Poland. Green Zoo Festival also has direct ties with [Pop Montreal Festival](https://popmontreal.com/) and has hosted many musicians that were initially showcased at this annual Canadian festival. In addition to the music, Green Zoo Festival provides means of promotion for upcoming local musicians, includes workshops dedicated to independent music, and is also associated with the development of volunteer programs

### History

The first edition of Green Zoo Festival was a one day event and was held on June 25, 2011 in [Kraków](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w) at the Betel Klub and Klub Pi?kny Pies venues. The idea of the festival was created spontaneously to help accommodate a concert by the Canadian songwriter [Basia Bulat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basia_Bulat), as organized by the music promoters from Front Row Heroes. The day before [Basia Bulat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basia_Bulat) performed in Kraków, at the invitation of [Arcade Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_Fire), she supported their very first concert in Poland at the [Arena COS Torwar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torwar_Hall) music venue in Warsaw.

It turned out that several local Kraków-based bands wanted to open for Basia Bulat's concert. This gave the festival organizers a chance to initiate a low profile urban music festival, loosely modeled on showcase festivals in Canada, USA, and elsewhere, where many bands play simultaneously in several different clubs and venues. The festival name, "**Green ZOO**", originates from the title of the hit song performed by the Polish singer from the 1960s, Ludmiła Jakubczak, called "[In the Green Zoo](https://youtu.be/hqNlQLC1xNg)" and has been permanently included in Basia Bulat's setlist during her concerts.

### Venues

The concerts in each festival edition are held at various Kraków venues including local pubs and clubs. The venue locations where concerts take place change from year to year. However, the festival concerts always take place in at least two separate venues each year, as shown in the table below. In 2016, before the summer Green Zoo Festival edition, a winter edition of the festival also took place at three separate locations, between January 30 and February 4. Due to the pandemic the 2020 edition of the festival was not held. During 2021, a fall edition of the festival was held.
